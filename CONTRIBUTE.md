1) ## Commit format:
    module: (feature/fix/other). Examples:
    "chat: fix json encoding",
    "nbt: Add zip compression",
    "all: code cleanup",
    "chat: find a better way to read tags in minimessage",
    "nbt & chat: code cleanup"

2) ## Keep it simple.
    over-abstraction makes maintainability very difficult.
    (I say this while having written my own buffer system just for optimization xD)

3) ## Follow checkstyle
    If you are using intellij or vscode, please install the plugin checkstyle

That's all!. Feel free to send your pull request or commit
